#
# Ok the AY8913 register writer
# this thing is a little pio program that does some fancy footwork
# to get around the fact that our chip input pins are split up 
# into 2 blocks
#  CHIPIN_LOW_NIBBLE  CHIPOUT_HIGH_NIBBLE  CHIPIN_HIGHNIBBLE
# so we define the pio output (which talks to the chip input) as a 12 bit thing
# then do some magic Mike dance using the ISR as a swap space, to finally 
# get our outputs right and ready for the chip input pins.
# This is done twice, so we latch the register, then the value
# appropriately, by using the side-set stuff (thankfully, those two 
# bidir pins are sequential).
# The state machine runs at 2MHz no problem, but if the program here is 
# optimized a bit, might need to tweak.
